# Auditrol Testing Arena - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

Auditrol Testing Arena is built as a modular Streamlit application with specialized components for semantic duplicate detection and code execution. This document provides detailed technical information about the system architecture, models used, and implementation details.

## Semantic Duplicate Detection Module

### Core Functionality

The Duplicate Detection module employs natural language processing and semantic embedding techniques to identify similar items in a dataset, even when they contain different wording. This is particularly useful for:

- Identifying redundant or duplicate data entries
- Finding related audit items that should be grouped
- Detecting subtle variations of the same underlying concept

### Embedding Models

The system supports multiple embedding models with different characteristics:

#### 1. all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Provider**: Sentence Transformers (Free)
- **Dimensions**: 384
- **STS Benchmark Score**: 84.0
- **Description**: A small, efficient model that provides a good balance between performance and speed
- **Best Use Case**: Quick prototyping and general-purpose text similarity tasks
- **Pros**: Fast, lightweight, no API key required
- **Cons**: Less accurate than larger models for nuanced text

#### 2. all-mpnet-base-v2
- **Provider**: Sentence Transformers (Free)
- **Dimensions**: 768
- **STS Benchmark Score**: 86.0
- **Description**: A more powerful model with improved semantic understanding
- **Best Use Case**: When accuracy is more important than speed
- **Pros**: Better semantic accuracy, still free to use
- **Cons**: Slower and more memory-intensive than MiniLM

#### 3. paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2
- **Provider**: Sentence Transformers (Free)
- **Dimensions**: 384
- **STS Benchmark Score**: 83.0
- **Description**: Multilingual model that works well across different languages
- **Best Use Case**: Datasets containing text in multiple languages
- **Pros**: Works with 50+ languages, free to use
- **Cons**: Slightly lower accuracy for English-only text compared to specialized English models

#### 4. text-embedding-3-large
- **Provider**: OpenAI (Paid)
- **Dimensions**: 3072
- **STS Benchmark Score**: 91.0
- **Description**: State-of-the-art embedding model with exceptional semantic understanding
- **Best Use Case**: Critical applications requiring highest accuracy
- **Pros**: Superior semantic understanding, handles nuanced text better
- **Cons**: Requires OpenAI API key, higher cost, slower processing

### Embedding Strategies

The module supports two different embedding strategies:

#### 1. Combined Strategy
- **Description**: Concatenates all selected columns into a single text string for embedding
- **Process**:
  1. Join selected column values with a separator
  2. Generate embeddings for the combined texts
  3. Create clusters based on similarity thresholds
- **Pros**: Faster, requires only one embedding operation per row
- **Cons**: May miss similarities in specific fields when other fields are very different

#### 2. Separate Strategy
- **Description**: Creates separate embeddings for each column and combines similarities
- **Process**:
  1. Generate embeddings for each column independently
  2. Calculate similarity matrices for each column
  3. Combine matrices with optional weighting
  4. Create clusters based on combined similarities
- **Pros**: More accurate when similarities exist in specific fields
- **Cons**: Slower, requires multiple embedding operations per row

### Similarity Calculation

The system uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between embeddings. The process works as follows:

1. Convert text data to numerical embeddings (vectors)
2. Calculate cosine similarity between vectors (ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity)
3. Apply a threshold (configurable, default: 0.75) to determine if items are similar enough to group
4. Create clusters of similar items

### Clustering Algorithm

The clustering approach uses a greedy algorithm:

1. Start with the first item as a cluster center
2. For each subsequent item:
   - Calculate similarity to all existing cluster centers
   - If similarity exceeds threshold, add to the most similar cluster
   - Otherwise, create a new cluster with this item as center
3. Assign each item to its cluster ID

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Embedding models can be memory-intensive, particularly for large datasets
- **Processing Time**: Scales with dataset size and model complexity
- **Optimization**: Batched processing for large datasets to manage memory usage

## Run Code Module

### Core Functionality

The Run Code module provides an interactive Python execution environment directly within the browser, allowing users to:

- Write and execute Python code snippets
- Upload and process data files
- Visualize results with integrated plotting libraries
- Capture and display execution output and errors

### Code Execution Environment

The execution environment is implemented with safety and usability in mind:

1. **Isolation**: Code is executed in a controlled environment
2. **Input/Output Capture**: Redirects stdout/stderr to capture prints and errors
3. **Variable Tracking**: Monitors created variables for inspection
4. **Error Handling**: Captures and displays Python errors with traceback

### Pre-loaded Libraries

The module comes with several pre-loaded libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: For numerical computations
- **plotly**: For interactive data visualizations
- **streamlit**: For UI components within the executed code

### Code Execution Process

1. User inputs code in the editor
2. System creates an execution environment with pre-loaded libraries
3. If data is uploaded/selected, it's made available as `df`
4. System redirects stdout/stderr and executes the code
5. Output, errors, execution time, and created variables are captured
6. Results are displayed in the UI

### Safety Considerations

The code execution environment implements several safety measures:

- AST parsing to detect syntax errors before execution
- Timeout for long-running code (prevents infinite loops)
- Limited access to system resources
- Error handling to prevent application crashes

## Data Processing Pipeline

## Implementation Notes

### Error Handling Strategy

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **User-Facing Errors**: Clear messages with suggested actions
2. **API Errors**: Detailed logging with fallback mechanisms
3. **Code Execution Errors**: Captured and displayed with context

### Logging

Detailed logging is implemented throughout the application:

- INFO: Standard operation logs
- WARNING: Non-critical issues that may affect results
- ERROR: Critical issues requiring attention
- DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting

### Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables, not in code
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Limited system access in code execution environment

## Known Limitations

1. **Large Dataset Performance**
   - Performance degrades with datasets larger than 10,000 rows
   - Memory constraints with high-dimensional embedding models

2. **Language Support**
   - Only the multilingual model supports non-English text effectively
   - Character encoding issues with some languages

3. **Code Execution**
   - Limited access to system resources for security
   - No persistence between code runs (stateless execution)
   - Limited debugging capabilities
